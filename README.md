WAVELET U-NET AND THE CHROMATIC ADAPTATION TRANSFORM FOR SINGLE IMAGE DEHAZING - ICIP 2019

This repository shows implementation of [Wavelet U-net](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8803391). This woek establish the new network combining wavelwt transrom for single image dehazing. We use [RESIDE](https://sites.google.com/view/reside-dehaze-datasets/reside-v0)dataset for evaluation, and it out outperforms the state-of-art algorithms.
